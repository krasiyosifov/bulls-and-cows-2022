    <h1>How to play?</h1>
    <button
    class="closeButton"
     type="button">X

    </button>

    <p>The game can be played by 2 people.</p>
    <p>First, Player1 enters their name and clicks the check button when they are done. After that a new text field
        appears where the player should input their chosen number, which should be kept secret from the other player.
        The digits must be all different. The number cannot start with 0. The number must have 4 digits. Same thing
        happens for Player2. </p>
    <p>Then, in turn, the players try to guess their opponent's number by inputting it in the four digit text field. The
        digits of the guessing number also must all be different. If the matching digits exist and are in their right
        positions, they are "bulls", if not, they are "cows". </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>P1’s number: 4271</li>
        <li>P2’s guessing number: 1234</li>
        <li>Answer: 1 bull and 2 cows. (The bull is "2", the cows are "4" and "1".)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the first round a list, which contains the already used guessing numbers, will appear in top left corner.
        On the right the player can look at the numbers from 1 to 9 and check which one is not needed anymore.</p>
    <p>In the top right corner there is a question button. If you need to check the rules of the game again you can
        press it.</p>
    <p>If both players win they can press the revenge button and play again.</p>
